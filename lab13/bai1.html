            <h3>The best Genshin Impact Ganyu build</h3>

            <p>Ganyu was introduced in the 1.2 update alongside the Dragonspine region, an icy location filled with
                plenty of frosty minions. Ganyu’s abilities work well against the enemies in this region, but you’ll
                find that Pyro characters fare significantly better against Cryo minions. She will be returning
                alongside Zhongli and others as part of a re-run banner due to go live on January 25, 2022, so keep an
                eye out for it.
                <br>
                Whether you want to focus on a high DPS build revolving around critical hits, or you prefer to play it
                safe by turning Ganyu into a support character, Ganyu can truly do it all. Here’s what you’ll need for
                the best build for Ganyu in Genshin Impact.
                <br>
                This DPS build focuses on getting the most out of Ganyu’s passive talents, specifically Undivided Heart,
                which can be extremely powerful in the correct setup. You’ll want to equip the Wanderer’s Troupe
                artifact set which drastically increases Ganyu’s charged attack damage when fully assembled. Not only
                does this impact the Frostlake Arrow, but it also grants the same damage bonus to its AoE bloom effect,
                dealing massive damage to multiple enemies.
